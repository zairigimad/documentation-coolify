---

You can run Coolify behind Cloudflare Tunnels. You can run Coolify on your local machine (like old laptop/raspberry pi) and expose it to the internet without opening any ports on your router.

> For more details about CF Tunnels, please visit [this page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/).

## Instance Configuration

After you completed CF Tunnels setup on your server, you can continue with the following steps.

- Coolify listens on port `8000` by default.
- From beta.154, a [Soketi](https://docs.soketi.app/) server is also started on port `6001`.


You have two options.
1. Set a wildcard domain for your tunnels.
2. Set a domain for each tunnel.

### Wildcard domain

You need to add a wildcard domain to your Tunnels settings, like `*.coolify.io`, pointing to the local ip address of your server (could be local ip or public ip, depending on your setup), on `http`. Port should be empty or 80.

This will allow to forward all requests to the Coolify proxy running.

1. Get your Tunnel ID from the Tunnels page, example: `8cad65a8-7fbb-45f2-86a3-6ccc2de0dfac`.
2. Add a `CNAME` DNS entry for `*.coolify.io` pointing to your Tunnel ID, example: `8cad65a8-7fbb-45f2-86a3-6ccc2de0dfac.cfargotunnel.com`.
3. Set SSL/TLS settings to `Full` (at least).

Now you need to use http for your Coolify instance AND for all your resources deployed by Coolify. The `Full` SSL configuration takes care of the encryption (https) between the client and Cloudflare.

So for example, you can set your instance url to `http://app.coolify.io`. 

### Domain for each tunnel
You need to map these two ports to your domains.

Let's say you have:
- `app.coolify.io` mapped to `8000`
- `realtime.coolify.io` mapped to `6001`

After you installed Coolify, you need to add 3 lines your `.env` file, located in `/data/coolify/source` folder.

```bash
APP_ID=<random string>
APP_KEY=<random string>
APP_NAME=Coolify
DB_PASSWORD=<random string>
PUSHER_APP_ID=<random string>
PUSHER_APP_KEY=<random string>
PUSHER_APP_SECRET=<random string>
REDIS_PASSWORD=<random string>

###########
# Add these lines
PUSHER_HOST=realtime.coolify.io
PUSHER_PORT=443
###########
```

This tells Coolify how to connect to it's realtime server through Cloudflare Tunnels.

Restart Coolify with the installation script.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash
```

> If you have a firewall, you also need to allow the [following ports](../server/firewall).
## Verify

1. Navigate to your Coolify instance, as in the example: `https://app.coolify.io`.
2. Login with the root user (the first user you created after installation).
3. Open another tab/window and navigate to `https://app.coolify.io/realtime`. On the other tab (opened in point 2), you should see a notification about the test event.
4. If you know what are you doing, you can check the network tab as well. Search for a websocket connection.
